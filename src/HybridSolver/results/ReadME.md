# Result

This folder contains the results generated by the Hybrid Solver and is divided into two sub-folders: one for the adjacency matrix instances and one for the TSPLIB instances.
Each sub-folder contains result files of the Classical/Hybrid Solver on an instance, which are simply the redirected outputs of stdout during the execution of the [`HybridSolver.py`](../main/HybridSolver.py) script.
Additionally, there is an [`analyzer.py`](./AdjacencyMatrix/analyzer.py) script that I created to compute the mean values of all the results within a folder.
